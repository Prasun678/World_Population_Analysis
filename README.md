World_Population_Analysis
World population analysis involves studying demographic patterns and trends to understand population growth, distribution, and composition. It examines factors like birth rates, death rates, migration, and age structure. Analysts use statistical and computational methods to predict future population changes and their implications for resources, economy, and environment. This analysis helps policymakers address challenges such as overpopulation, urbanization, and aging populations. By understanding population dynamics, strategies can be developed to ensure sustainable development, improve public health, and manage resources effectively. This field combines data science, sociology, and economics to provide insights into human populations.
